check if a square is threathen by more knights than our knight protecting it

If start first, prioritize attack
else prioritize defense
because move first have advantage

check if any knights have a posiblity of getting check
if there are then the owner of the knight has an advantage
also check if any knights are attacked and not protected, the attacker has the advantage then


(w1 * attack score) + (w2 * defense score)


hard code the first few moves


check if we move the horse then the apple get eaten then don't move (the horse is protecting the orange square & enemy can move there)
